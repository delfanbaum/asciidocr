= Limitations

This is a rough-and-ready list of current-state features, planned features, and
non-features.

== Language Features in a Non-Working State

* Section IDs are not auto-generated
* Custom IDs/reference text

== Working Caveats

Tables:: Tables are rendered as expected, save that `asciidocr` does not
currently respect column width designations; `cols="3,1,1"` will still produce a
three-column table, but with columns of "default" widths. Tables also do not
currently support spanning columns or rows; if you require this functionality,
please use an HTML table in a passthrough block.

== Language Features Planned for Inclusion Later

* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/attributes/positional-and-named-attributes/#block-style-and-attribute-shorthand[block style
attribute short hand] -- I'm both not a fan (just use `role=` and `[[id]]`, etc.!) and parsing this is going to be semi-annoying so I shall put it off.
* Hardbreaks-option attribute (which we shall include for our poet friends who
  don't want to have to wrap everything in `[verse]`) 
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/document/author-information/[Author information]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/document/revision-information/[Revision information]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/document/metadata/[Document metadata]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/document/doctype/[Document types]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/sections/section-ref/[Section
  Attributes and styles]
* Paragraph alignment and indented blocks 
* Substitutions (quote substitutions now working!)
* Checklists
* Autolinks for emails (http:: urls now work!)
* `mailto:`
* `Footnote:id` syntax (this may not happen)
* Icons
* Keyboard/button/etc. macros (I mean to target "writers," first, then
  "technical writers" at some later point).
* Syntax highlighting for source blocks
* STEM and equations
* Automatic Tables of Contents
* Deeply nested description lists (in the meantime: just use an open block)
* Discrete Headings

== Language Features Not Currently Planned for Inclusion

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/audio-and-video/[Audio and
video]:: Maybeâ€¦ later? Not part of the current project target(s), which are more
document-focused.

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/footnote/#externalizing-a-footnote[Externalized
footnotes]:: I think that it's clearer to include footnote text where it ought
to go (and don't really believe there are many great footnote reuse use-cases);
Supporting this would require a second-pass on the attribute parsing, which
we're not really doing at the moment. Can be added later, but no plans
currently.

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/attributes/counters/[Counters]::
Given that these are a "poorly defined feature in Asciidoc," and I've never,
myself, found a use for them, there are no plans for support.

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/conditionals/[Conditionals]::
This probably wouldn't be too hard to implement, but (selfishly) I've yet to
find a need for these, so have no current plans for supporting them. If this is
of interest, open an issue.

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/blocks/collapsible/[Collapsible
blocks]:: Again, this feels a more web-oriented feature; at least for the
moment, we're targeting document creation.
